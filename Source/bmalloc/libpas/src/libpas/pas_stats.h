/*
 * === Overview ===
 * This is a rudimentary stat-counter collection system, intended primarily for
 * tracking libpas-internal statistics & performance data.
 *
 * By default, it is disabled -- `#define PAS_ENABLE_STATS 1` will enable it at
 * compile time.
 * Even when compiled in, each individual metric is by default disabled at runtime.
 * To enable one at runtime you must pass a comma-separated
 * list of stat names to the PAS_STATS_ENABLE environment variable
 * e.g. `PAS_STATS_ENABLE=malloc_info_bytes,malloc_info_allocations`
 * or, to enable all stat-counters: `PAS_STATS_ENABLE=1`
 *
 * === Logging Stats ===
 * Stats are logged as textual json dumps at periodic intervals,
 * effectively producing a .jsonl file in the output. See below for a schema.
 * Only stats which are enabled are logged.
 *
 * Rough json schema (prettified):
 * ```
 * {
 *   "pid": <INT>,
 *   "time_ns": <INT>,
 *   "per_stat_data": {
 *     "<STATNAME_1>": {
 *        ...
 *     },
 *     "<STATNAME_2>": {
 *        ...
 *     },
 *     ...
 *     "<STATNAME_N>": {
 *        ...
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Stats are logged to a 'sink'.
 * By default, this sink is stdout, but you can set
 * `PAS_STATS_LOG_FILE=<filename>` to instead log to a file.
 *
 * === Adding New Stats ===
 *
 * To add a new stat counter, you need to do two things:
 * 1) Add a new entry in PAS_STATS_FOR_EACH_COUNTER, including
 *   - the name of the stat (e.g. `mmap_count`)
 *   - a struct (e.g. `struct mmap_count_data`) which will be used
 *     to store the stat counter data accumulated at runtime
 *   - a function to dump that struct to json (e.g. mmap_count_dump_to_json)
 * 2) Define a new macro PAS_RECORD_STATE_<name> which takes a pointer to the
 *    data struct registered above, other arguments as necessary, and then
 *    actually accumulates into that struct.
 * Then go add PAS_RECORD_STAT(<name>, arg1, ..., argN); wherever in the
 * codebase to capture into your new stat-counter.
 *
 * === Stat Logging Design Notes ===
 *
 * Since not all environments in which libpas runs have a clean 'exit' hook
 * (e.g. Safari tends to call terminate() in order to ensure it exits quickly)
 * this system instead logs all counters periodically, based on the total number
 * of stat-count-events which have taken place across all threads:
 * PAS_STATS_LOG_INTERVAL controls the rate at which this happens.
 * The reason for not doing this in the scavenger is that the scavenger runs
 * infrequently enough that relying on it leads to significant under-reporting
 * of stat counter values.
 *
 * It would be relatively easy to add a subsidiary time-based interval check:
 * just make sure that current_time_ns() is only called inside
 * pas_stats_do_accounting_before_recording_stat_slow_path(), i.e. underneath
 * the check for `new_count == PAS_STATS_LOG_INTERVAL`.
 *
 * Note that PAS_STATS_LOG_INTERVAL is fixed and does not depend on how many /
 * which counters are actually enabled. If you add a counter that is not hit
 * very often, and enable only that counter, you may not see that counterget
 * logged during runtime. To get around this you can either A) temporarily
 * change PAS_STATS_LOG_INTERVAL and recompile, or B) enable some other stats
 * that are accumulated more frequently.
 *
 * === Implementation Notes ===
 *
 * In order to make the stat-collection-sites inlineable in libpas' C codebase,
 * we use a C-style macro-for-each to enumerate the stats that are available for
 * collection.
 * To register a new stat-counter, you must do three things:
 *   1. Add a new line to PAS_STATS_FOR_EACH_COUNTER with
 *     - the name of your stat
 *     - the struct to be used to carry its data: the first member of this
 *       struct should be of type `pas_stats_stat_base` and named 'base'.
 *     - a function which serializes your struct to json: this struct should not
 *       allocate memory of its own, but instead prefer calling
 *       `pas_stats_ensure_print_buffer` with whatever size of memory is
 *       necessary.
 *   2. Define a new PAS_RECORD_STAT_<statname> macro with the desired arguments
 *     - this should call the function which actually modifies your stat-struct;
 *       this function must handle its own synchronization.
 *   3. Add calls to PAS_RECORD_STAT(<statname>, <args...>) to the relevant
 *      points inside of libpas.
 * The fact that we need #2 is somewhat undesirable (in principle we should just
 * generate that table automatically from PAS_STATS_FOR_EACH_COUNTER) but I
 * couldn't find a way to do so ergonomically.
 *
 * Since this framework is intended for use inside of an allocator, it is
 * intended to have low overhead (both for enabled and disabled counters) and to
 * have minimal use of heap-allocated memory -- however, there is room for
 * improvement on both counts.
 *   - Re.: heap-allocated memory, on the logging path we currently do rely on
 *     heap allocations to make it easier for people to add new counters, as
 *     using a fixed-size static allocation per counter would mean every counter
 *     would need to pre-compute the theoretical maximum size of its json
 *     payload.
 *     Normally the utility heap would be a good fit for this use-case, but to
 *     avoid reentrancy we do not use libpas to allocate this memory -- even by
 *     going through the system heap. Instead, we call `malloc` directly. These
 *     buffers are cached so it shouldn't happen often but it would be better to
 *     be able to remove that dependency.
 *   - Re.: performance, the current design is not bad but does introduce a lot
 *     of atomic traffic and cross-core contention. Ideally, we would instead
 *     have a per-thread 'local stat counter cache' which we would then
 *     periodically accumulate into a global stat-counter object. Individual
 *     stat counters would have to be aware since they need to implement their
 *     own accumulate functions.
 *     Even better than thread-local would be if we had something like Linux'
 *     rseqs, as we could then store this data per-CPU and avoid any migration
 *     whatsoever.
 *     In both cases though, we would risk under-counting statistics unless we
 *     implemented an analog of what pas-TLCs do where they iterate over other
 *     threads' TLCs and collect data out. Doing so generically across all kinds
 *     of stat counters seems like a challenge.

/* 
 * The goal here is to track some stat (# allocs, # bytes) across varying
 * allocation-sizes. Rather than using a hashmap, we use a fixed number of
 * buckets: this works well enough since libpas itself only allocates objects
 * as belonging to a given size-class.
 * Obviously extending this to 'all possible allocation sizes' would have
 * diminishing returns, so all objects above
 * PAS_STATS_MALLOC_INFO_LOW_GRANULARITY_MAX_SIZE just get lumped into a single
 * bucket.
 *
 * Instead of using a constant bucket width for all allocations, we vary
 * them such that smaller allocations get logged with a higher granularity.
 * Since the libpas size-category boundaries differ from pas_heap to pas_heap, we
 * don't attempt to use those -- instead the numbers below are intended to be a
 * conservative superset, such that we get at least as much granularity as the
 * actual pas size-class for a given allocation size.
 *
 * To justify this scheme: the naive, non-tiered approach would involve
 * MAX_SIZE / BUCKET_SIZE =
 * (1 << PAS_VA_BASED_ZERO_MEMORY_SHIFT) / (1 << MIN_ALIGN_SHIFT) =
 * ((1 << 24) / (1 << 4)) * 8B = 8MiB of storage per malloc_info stat counter,
 * which memory-wise is perhaps excusable since that price is only paid when
 * we're building with PAS_ENABLE_STATS, but that takes a copious amount of time
 * to log which significantly distorts the stat logging functionality.
 *
 * The actual sizes are technically arbitrary, but they are chosen to dominate
 * the typical size-category boundaries used by the bmalloc_heap &c.
